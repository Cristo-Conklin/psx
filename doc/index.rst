PSX Framework
=============

PSX is a framework written in PHP to create RESTful APIs. It provides tools to 
handle routing, API versioning, data transformation, authentication, 
documentation and testing. With PSX you can easily build an REST API around an 
existing application or create a new one from scratch. More informations at
http://phpsx.org.

This manual is seperated into three chapters. The :doc:`getting_started` chapter
contains all informations to quickly create an REST API with PSX. The 
:doc:`design` chapter contains more technical details about the anatomy of PSX. 
The last chapter :doc:`concept` covers various concepts to get a deeper 
understanding of PSX.

Help
----

Because PSX is in an early stage the manual is not complete. I appreciate every 
help in making this documentation better. The documentation is written in 
reStructuredText and uses the sphinx documentation generator. If you have made 
changes that you want commit please submit a pull request.
