/**
 * The handler is an interface to CRUD records. A handler has a fixed amount of 
 * fields wich can be queried. The fields can be i.e. an select from an database 
 * or a result from an api request. By using an handler in your domain logic you 
 * remove the connection from sql queries to your application. In this way you 
 * could easily get the latest news from an api endpoint or nosql database 
 * instead of an mysql database
