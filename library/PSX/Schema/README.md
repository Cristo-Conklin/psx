## About

The SQL library helps to manage data from relational databases. It contains a
system to build complex data structures from flat SQL results and a simple
table interface which can be used as an alternative to an ORM. Each table class
represents a table on the database and offers standard methods to CRUD data to
the table. It is also easy possible to add custom methods to a table.

## Usage
